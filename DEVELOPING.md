# Developing NiFi Rocks

This document describes how to build, test, and validate the Apache NiFi Rocks packaged in this repository.

---

## Installing dependencies

Building the rock needs Rockcraft and an LXD backend:

```bash
sudo snap install rockcraft --classic
sudo snap install lxd && sudo lxd init --auto
sudo adduser "$USER" lxd && newgrp lxd
```

Running the smoke tests additionally needs `just`, `yq`, `jq`, `goss`/`kgoss`,
and a microk8s cluster:

```bash
sudo snap install just --classic     
sudo snap install yq
sudo apt-get install -y jq

goss_base_url="https://github.com/goss-org/goss/releases/latest/download"
sudo curl -L "${goss_base_url}/goss-linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture)" -o /usr/local/bin/goss
sudo curl -L "${goss_base_url}/kgoss" -o /usr/local/bin/kgoss
sudo chmod +rx /usr/local/bin/goss /usr/local/bin/kgoss
```

```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --classic
sudo snap install kubectl --classic
sudo usermod -a -G microk8s "$USER"
sudo chown -R "$USER" ~/.kube
newgrp microk8s                        

microk8s status --wait-ready
sudo microk8s enable registry

microk8s config | tee ~/.kube/config > /dev/null
chmod 600 ~/.kube/config

kubectl get nodes                    
```

Each version directory contains everything needed to build that NiFi release.

## Building the Rock

To build the NiFi Rock, go to the directory that corresponds to your desired version. For example:

```bash
cd 2.10
rockcraft pack
```

This produces a `.rock` artifact (`nifi_2.10.0_amd64.rock`) in the same directory.
Or via the justfile, from the repository root:

```bash
just pack 2.10
just clean 2.10
```

---

## Testing the Rock

`just test <version>` packs the rock, pushes it to the microk8s registry on
`localhost:32000`, and runs the `goss.yaml` smoke tests in a pod started from
that image — pulled by digest, so the container under test is exactly the image
just pushed.

`goss_wait.yaml` gates the run until NiFi answers on its API. 
`goss.yaml` asserts on things NiFi writes during startup
(`flow.json.gz`, the generated sensitive key, an error-free app log). Expect the first wait attempt to fail and the second to pass a few seconds later; that is the gate working.

```bash
just test 2.10
```

Use `just run 2.10` instead to drop into `kgoss edit`, an interactive session
against the same container - useful when adding or debugging assertions.


> The port check uses `tcp6:8080`, not `tcp:8080`. NiFi's Jetty binds a
> dual-stack IPv6 wildcard socket, so the listener appears only in
> `/proc/net/tcp6`; an IPv4-only check never matches even though the port is
> serving.

---

## Artifact sourcing and verification

The rock consumes the `-ubuntuN` artifact built from source by the SOSS pipeline and published by
[central-uploader](https://github.com/canonical/central-uploader/releases), and
prunes its NARs.

The `nifi` part pins both the artifact URL and the publisher's SHA-512 in
`source-checksum`. Rockcraft verifies the digest during the pull step, so a
swapped, truncated, or corrupted artifact **fails the build** before anything is
unpacked.


---

## NAR pruning

The NiFi distribution ships 119 NARs in `lib/`. Pruning is controlled by the
`NAR_ALLOWLIST` build environment variable in `rockcraft.yaml`:

| `NAR_ALLOWLIST` | Behaviour |
| :---- | :---- |
| `nars.keep` (default) | Keep only the NARs listed in that file (23) |
| `""` | Keep every NAR the distribution ships; logged at build time |
| names a missing file | Build fails with an explicit error |

The behaviour is driven by the variable rather than by whether a file happens to
exist, so both modes are visible in `rockcraft.yaml`

`nars.keep` is an **allowlist**: anything not listed is deleted, and anything
listed that is *not* found in the distribution fails the build rather than shrinking the image.

When bumping the version, re-check that each kept NAR's `Nar-Dependency-Id`
still resolves inside the keep-set; NiFi's classloader logs unsatisfied NAR
dependencies on startup.

## Versioning

Each NiFi version maintains its own isolated build definition under `<major.minor>/`. Future versions follow the same structure.
