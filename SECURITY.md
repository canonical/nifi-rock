# Security Policy — NiFi Rock (OCI Image)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The easiest way to report a security issue is through a [GitHub Private Security Report](https://github.com/canonical/nifi-rocks/security/advisories/new) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

Alternatively, to report a security issue via email, please email [security@ubuntu.com](mailto:security@ubuntu.com) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.

## Supported Versions

The NiFi rock follows the Apache NiFi release cadence, built on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. The product currently ships interim releases; no LTS commitment is made at this time.

| Rock Version | Apache NiFi | Ubuntu Base              | Status          | End of Standard Support |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |

Older rock versions receive no further security updates. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a supported version.
